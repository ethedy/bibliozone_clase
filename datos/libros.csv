The collection's three sections address broad issues related to genre, Harry Potter's development as the central heroic character and the question of who qualifies as a hero in the Harry Potter series. Among the topics are Harry Potter as both epic and postmodern hero, the series as a modern-day example of psychomachia, the series' indebtedness to the Gothic tradition, Harry's development in the first six film adaptations, Harry Potter and the idea of the English gentleman, Hermione Granger's explicitly female version of heroism, adult role models in Harry Potter, and the complex depictions of heroism exhibited by the series' minor characters. Together, the essays suggest that the Harry Potter novels rely on established generic, moral and popular codes to develop new and genuine ways of expressing what a globalized world has applauded as ethically exemplary models of heroism based on responsibility, courage, humility and kindness.;Literary Criticism;10591.77;ARS;5;1;en;https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o-QCOFDHmPEC;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o-QCOFDHmPEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/o-QCOFDHmPEC

Focusing on the U.S. media but seeing them in a comparative context, Schudson brings his understanding of news as at once a story-telling and fact-centered practice to bear on a variety of controversies about what public knowledge today is and what it should be. Should experts have a role in governing democracies? Is news melodramatic or is it ironic – or is it both at different times? In the title essay, Schudson even suggests that journalism serves the interests of free expression and democracy best when it least lives up to the demands of media critics for deep thought and analysis, passion for the sensational event may be news at its democratically most powerful. Lively, provocative, unconventional, and deeply informed by a rich understanding of journalism’s history, this work collects the best of Schudson’s recent writings, including several pieces published here for the first time.;Language Arts & Disciplines;1836.52;ARS;0;0;en;https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hmYGMe9ecKUC;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hmYGMe9ecKUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/hmYGMe9ecKUC

This volume (based partly on research presented at IGCP 317Palaeoweathering Records and Palaeosurfaces) contains contributionsthat use both geochemical and physical approaches to the study ofpalaeoweathering problems. The former are particularly relevant toour understanding of past climates and climate change, the latterhave applications in the understanding of mass balance betweenrates of erosion and deposition. Palaeoweathering, Palaeosurfaces and Related ContinentalDeposits illustrates the multidisciplinary nature of the subject,the diversity of techniques and, above all, the vital contributionthe subject makes to the reconstruction of ancient continentalenvironments.

This new edition of the bestselling Randomization, Bootstrap and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology illustrates the value of a number of these methods with an emphasis on biological applications. This textbook focuses on three related areas in computational statistics: randomization, bootstrapping, and Monte Carlo methods of inference. The author emphasizes the sampling approach within randomization testing and confidence intervals. Similar to randomization, the book shows how bootstrapping, or resampling, can be used for confidence intervals and tests of significance. It also explores how to use Monte Carlo methods to test hypotheses and construct confidence intervals.

The now well known underlying idea is the following : consider a sample X of Xl ' n independent and identically distributed H.i.d.) random variables (r. v,'s) with unknown probability measure (p.m.) P . Assume we are interested in approximating the distribution of a statistical functional T(P ) the -1 nn empirical counterpart of the functional T(P) , where P n := n l:i=l aX. is 1 the empirical p.m. Since in some sense P is close to P when n is large, n • • LLd. from P and builds the empirical p.m. if one samples Xl ' ... , Xm n n -1 mn • • P T(P ) conditionally on := mn l: i =1 a • ' then the behaviour of P m n,m n n n X. 1 T(P ) should imitate that of when n and mn get large. n This idea has lead to considerable investigations to see when it is correct, and when it is not. When it is not, one looks if there is any way to adapt it.;Mathematics;7942.9;ARS;0;0;en;https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=edXvBwAAQBAJ;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=edXvBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/edXvBwAAQBAJ
RWTlSs8e5KkC;9781139452021;1139452029;Bootstrap Techniques for Signal Processing;;2004-05-06;0;Cambridge University Press;NOT_MATURE;The statistical bootstrap is one of the methods that can be used to calculate estimates of a certain number of unknown parameters of a random process or a signal observed in noise, based on a random sample. Such situations are common in signal processing and the bootstrap is especially useful when only a small sample is available or an analytical analysis is too cumbersome or even impossible. This book covers the foundations of the bootstrap, its properties, its strengths and its limitations. The authors focus on bootstrap signal detection in Gaussian and non-Gaussian interference as well as bootstrap model selection. The theory developed in the book is supported by a number of useful practical examples written in MATLAB. The book is aimed at graduate students and engineers, and includes applications to real-world problems in areas such as radar and sonar, biomedical engineering and automotive engineering.;Technology & Engineering;;;0;0;en;https://books.google.com/books/about/Bootstrap_Techniques_for_Signal_Processi.html?hl=&id=RWTlSs8e5KkC;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RWTlSs8e5KkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RWTlSs8e5KkC

These programs typically offer training and loans to individuals seeking to operate very small businesses. MDPs are often presented as a path to the self-sufficiency that comes with entrepreneurship and as an example of the success of market-based alternatives to government programs. In Bootstrap Dreams, Nancy C. Jurik analyzes the origins and maturation of these programs in the United States. Based on a national sample of fifty programs and an eight-year case study of one in particular, this is a rare book about microenterprise development. Jurik understands the positive social mission of MDPs, but she is not blind to the problems that they encounter. Jurik's clear perception of potential difficulties and her keen ability to place the microenterprise movement in the larger context of welfare reform and globalization make Bootstrap Dreams a valuable book.;Business & Economics;;;0;0;en;https://books.google.com/books/about/Bootstrap_Dreams.html?hl=&id=BXuzMLIPhlkC;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BXuzMLIPhlkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BXuzMLIPhlkC
